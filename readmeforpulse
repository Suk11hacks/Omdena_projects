Explanation of the Code
This code extracts biometric features from videos to predict pulse rate using a Random Forest Regressor model. The process is divided into three key stages:

Data Preparation:

Google Drive Integration: The dataset, including video metadata and recordings, is accessed from Google Drive.
Metadata Loading: A CSV file containing video file paths and biometric details is loaded.
Feature Extraction from Videos:

OpenCV & MediaPipe for Processing: Each video is read frame by frame, converting frames to grayscale. The forehead region is extracted to estimate pulse rate based on intensity changes.
Peak Detection with scipy.signal.find_peaks: The signal is analyzed for periodic intensity variations, representing heartbeats.
Processing Optimization: Every 5th frame is processed to improve speed while maintaining accuracy.
Machine Learning Model (Random Forest) for Prediction:

Feature Engineering: The video processing time is used as a feature. More features like forehead intensity could be added.
Random Forest Regressor: Trained on extracted features and known pulse rates, this ensemble learning algorithm predicts new pulse rates based on unseen videos.
Model Evaluation: The Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 4.74 BPM) evaluates prediction accuracy.
Model Deployment: The trained model is saved using joblib for future use. A function predicts pulse rates from new videos.
Concepts Involved
1. Feature Extraction
Forehead Intensity Variation: Frames are converted to grayscale, and forehead intensity changes over time are analyzed for periodic heartbeats.
Peak Detection (scipy.signal.find_peaks) finds peaks in the intensity signal corresponding to heartbeats.
Frame Skipping (5th frame processing): Reduces computational load while maintaining accuracy.
2. Machine Learning with Random Forest
Why Random Forest?

Handles non-linearity in biometric signals.
Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.
Works well with small datasets.
Feature Selection: Only video processing time is used initially, but additional features (e.g., forehead intensity, frame-level variations) could improve accuracy.

Hyperparameters Used:

n_estimators=50: Uses 50 decision trees to create a robust model.
random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility.
Why Specific Parameters Were Chosen?
Frame Skipping (5th frame processing) → Reduces processing time while capturing enough biometric variations.
Peak Detection (distance=30) → Ensures detection of valid heartbeats, assuming 30 FPS video input.
Random Forest (50 estimators) → Balances computational efficiency and accuracy.
Train-Test Split (80-20%) → Provides sufficient data for both training and evaluation.
Summary (50 Words)
This code extracts pulse rate from videos using forehead intensity variations. It applies OpenCV for feature extraction, detects peaks with scipy.signal.find_peaks, and trains a Random Forest Regressor for prediction. The trained model achieves 4.74 BPM MAE and is saved for real-time pulse rate estimation on new videos.
